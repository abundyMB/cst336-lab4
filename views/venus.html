        <p class="pl-3 text-left"> Venus, the second planet from the sun, is one of the most 
        Earth-like planets in the Solar System. However, while Earth and Venus were likely 
        twin planets for most of their lives, Venus's evolution took a radical turn about a 
        billion years ago. Perhaps the result of volcanic eruptions flooding the atmosphere with
        greenhouse gases, Venus today now hosts the hotest surface temperatures in the Solar 
        System (over 860 F), an atmosphere pressure 90 times that of Earth's, and an atomospheric 
        partly composed of sulfuric acid. It's no wonder then why Venus is considered Earth's evil twin.</p>

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Strange Rotation:</h5>
            <p>Unlike most of the other planets, Venus rotates in an opposite direction from
            the rest of the planets. Additionaly, a day there is longer than a year (243 Earth-days
            per Venusian day, 224 Earth-days per Venusian year).

            <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Potential Life:</h5>
            <p>Temperatures hot enough to melt lead. A crushing, acidic atmosphere. These
            hellish conditions seem like the last place one would find life. Yet, some 
            scientists suggest that life could survive on Venus. Or rather, in Venus's 
            clouds. The planet's upper atmosphere offers a much more hospitable environment
            conducive to lifeforms that ride air currents and stay above the deadly surface.
